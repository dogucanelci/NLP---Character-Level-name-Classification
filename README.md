# <h style= "color:red;font-size:50px">NLP FROM SCRATCH: CLASSIFYING NAMES WITH A CHARACTER-LEVEL RNN,Custom-RNN,CNN and Bi-LSTM</h>
<l style="font-size:30 px;">In this project, approximately 20.000 tagged names from 18 languages were trained on a character basis using 8 different models, different batch-sizes and embedding-layers, and the results were shown.</l><br>
<br><l style="font-size:30px;font-weight:bold">Used models:</l><br><br>
<strong>1- Include Embedding Layer:</strong><br>

•&nbsp;CNN | batch-sizes: [128,64,32,16,8]<br>
•&nbsp;bi-LSTM | batch-sizes: [128,64,32,16,8]<br>
•&nbsp;nn.RNN | batch-sizes: [128,64,32,16,8]<br>
•&nbsp;Customized-RNN | batch-sizes: [128]<br>
<br>
<strong>2- Without Embedding Layer:</strong><br><br>
•&nbsp; CNN | batch-sizes: [128,64,32,16,8]<br>
•&nbsp;bi-LSTM | batch-sizes: [128,64,32,16,8]<br>
•&nbsp;nn.RNN | batch-sizes: [128,64,32,16,8]<br>
